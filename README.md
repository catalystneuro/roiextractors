## About

ROIExtractors provides a common API for various optical imaging and segmentation formats to streamline conversion and data analysis. ROI stands for Region Of Interest, which is the region in a set of acquired fluorescence images which the segmentation software has determined as a neuron.

Features:

* Reads data from 10+ popular optical imaging and segmentation data formats into a common API.
* Extracts relevant metadata from each format.
* Provides a handy set of methods to analyze data such as `get_roi_locations()`

## Installation

To install the latest stable release of **roiextractors** though PyPI, type:
```shell
pip install roiextractors
```

For more flexibility we recommend installing the latest version directly from GitHub. The following commands create an environment with all the required dependencies and the latest updates:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/catalystneuro/roiextractors
cd roiextractors
conda env create roiextractors_env
conda activate roiextractors_env
pip install -e .
```
Note that this will install the package in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#editable-installs).

Finally, if you prefer to avoid `conda` altogether, the following commands provide a clean installation within the current environment:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/catalystneuro/roiextractors.git@main
```

## Documentation
See our [ReadTheDocs page](https://roiextractors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for full documentation, including a gallery of all supported formats.

## Developer Guide

### Example Datasets
Example datasets are maintained at https://gin.g-node.org/CatalystNeuro/ophys_testing_data.

To download test data on your machine,

1. Install the gin client (instructions [here](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GIN+CLI+Setup#linux))
2. Use gin to download data.
```shell
gin get CatalystNeuro/ophys_testing_data
cd ophys_testing_data
gin get-content
```

3. Change the file at `roiextractors/tests/gin_test_config.json` to point to the path of this test data

To update data later, `cd` into the test directory and run `gin get-content`

### Troubleshooting
##### Installing SIMA with python>=3.7:
Will need a manual installation for package dependency **SIMA** since it does not currently support python 3.7:
1.   Download SIMA wheels distribution [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#sima).
2.  `pip install <download-path-to-wheels.whl>`
3.  `pip install roiextractors`

## Funding
ROIExtractors is funded by
* Stanford University as part of the Ripple U19 project (U19NS104590).
* LBNL as part of the NWB U24 (U24NS120057).
